## Problem 1
I created a GitHub account and installed GitHub Desktop. Then, I created a new public repository and added code files for this assignment.

I committed the files and pushed the repository to GitHub. Now I can see my files online at:

[My Repository Link](https://github.com/Klina123/AAE718)

This line was added in `problem2-branch`.
